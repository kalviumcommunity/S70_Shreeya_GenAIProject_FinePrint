# FinePrint
FinePrint is an AI-powered tool that simplifies dense legal documents like terms of service or privacy policies. Users can upload a document and ask plain-English questions, and the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant sections from the text. It then returns structured, easy-to-understand answers highlighting key clauses, risk levels, and action suggestions. With built-in function calling, FinePrint can flag problematic clauses, generate summary reports, or send alerts â€” all triggered directly from user input. Powered by advanced prompting and structured output, it makes legal language accessible, transparent, and actionable for everyone.

#How it uses RAG:
Finds relevant legal documents to answer the users questions effectively and accurately. Breaks the provided document into chunks for processing and produces a brief summary

#Prompting:
Uses user prompt for acquiring the large text chunks and produces predictable and controlled answers

#Function calling: 
uses function calling for an interactive and not just descriptive

#Structured output: 
providing structured output by making it easy to display in the form of flashcards or tables, easy to use programme and test it .
