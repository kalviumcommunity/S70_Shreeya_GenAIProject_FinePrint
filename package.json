  "description": "FinePrint is an AI-powered tool that simplifies dense legal documents like terms of service or privacy policies. Users can upload a document and ask plain-English questions, and the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant sections from the text. It then returns structured, easy-to-understand answers highlighting key clauses, risk levels, and action suggestions. With built-in function calling, FinePrint can flag problematic clauses, generate summary reports, or send alerts â€” all triggered directly from user input. Powered by advanced prompting and structured output, it makes legal language accessible, transparent, and actionable for everyone.",
